#welcome to my python lesson

# how to make a variable
# you can use like a camelCase
# or a PascalCase
# or a snake_case


#example of naming a variable using camelCase
multiPlicaTionVariable = 12

#12 x 12
answer = multiPlicaTionVariable * multiPlicaTionVariable
#then print the answer
print(answer)

 
#this is an example of PasCal naming
PowerOfTwoVariable = 12

#using type you can able defined what is that variable you input
print(type(PowerOfTwoVariable))

#last one is the snake_one_where_it_more_has_an underscore

my_name_is = "William"
#you can also change the variable to new one
#try to change this variable or comment it
my_name_is = "John"
print(my_name_is + " B. Adornado Jr.")


#====================================================

#you can also make an array of vairable using this

#           0        1        2
array = "Orange", "Apple", "Grape"
print(array)

#you can also make call this specific
# 2  = Grape
print(array[2])

#also you can do this one
apple, orange, mango = "Apple","Orange","Mango"
print(orange)
print(apple)
print(mango)

# you can also combine this three
# without space
print(orange + apple + mango)
# with space
print(orange, apple, mango)
